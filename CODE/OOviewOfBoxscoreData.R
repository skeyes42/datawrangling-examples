# DESCRIPTION: 
# This R program is a data modeling and transformation tool. 
# Its main objective is to read flat data tables from a database 
# and reconstruct them into a structured, hierarchical collection 
# of R objects that mimic the physical world of a basketball 
# season (Season -> Game -> Team -> Player).
